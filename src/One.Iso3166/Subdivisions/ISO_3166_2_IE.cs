        /// the letters are generally the same as those currently used in vehicle registration plates, with the following exceptions:
        ///     County Cork vehicles rather than CO use C; in ISO 3166-2 the latter is used for the province of Connacht.
        ///     three counties where there were multiple councils and vehicle codes until the Local Government Reform Act 2014:
        ///         County Limerick vehicles rather than LK now use L, which had been restricted to the city of Limerick before 2014
        ///         County Waterford vehicles rather than WD now use W, which had been restricted to the city of Waterford before 2014
